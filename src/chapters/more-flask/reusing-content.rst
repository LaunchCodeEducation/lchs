Reusing Content
===============

Starting in the :ref:`HTML chapter <html-chapter>`, we've often pasted a block
of starter code into an empty ``.html`` file. This *boilerplate* code often
looks the same across different pages:

.. sourcecode:: html
   :linenos:

   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
      <head>
         <meta charset="UTF-8">
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
         <title></title>
         <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
      </head>
      <body>

      </body>
   </html>

In Visual Studio Code, typing the ``html:5`` shortcut into a blank document
shortens this task, but the same issue remains.

   We're putting the same blocks of code into most of our HTML files.

We can save ourselves a lot of time, and keep our work DRY, by putting reusable
code in a single file.

A ``base`` Template

Lorem ipsum...

Demo idea: Header and footer content/image(s) that we want to appear on every
page.

This can be done, but it's beyond the scope of this course.
