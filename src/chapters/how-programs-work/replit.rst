Replit.com
==========

`Replit.com <https://replit.com>`__ and `Trinket.io <https://trinket.io>`__ share
many of the same features, but the two sites differ in how they present their
workspaces.

The previous page explored Trinket, so now let's take a look at Replit.com

Create a Replit.com Account
---------------------------

.. admonition:: Warning

   Before signing up for a replit.com account, be sure your school has approved
   the site for student use!

Create a new student account with `Replit.com <https://replit.com/signup>`__.

   :alt: The Replit.com sign-up screen.

After you sign in, you will see your *Home* screen, which displays your recent
work and announcements. Since you are just starting out, you won't need to do
much on this screen.

   Home screen

Click on *new repl (1) or (2)* to begin a new project. Scroll through the options and
select *Python (3)*. Next, name your project (4) and click *Create Repl (5)*.

The Replit.com Workspace
------------------------

Now let's take a look at how to use Replit. The workspace consists of three
main panels and several menu functions.

Features to note:

#. **File panel and menus**: Allows you to add extensions, update settings, and
   add, open, or delete files.
#. **Editor panel**: Your code goes here. Click on a file to open it in the
   editor. For most new projects, a ``main.py`` file will be created and opened
   by default.
#. **Console panel**: Any output produced by your code will appear in this
   panel. The console also displays error messages, test results, and other
   information.
#. **Run button**: Executes any code written in the ``main.py`` file.
#. **Share button**: Allows you to share your projects.
#. **Managing projects**: When logged into Repl.it, you can create a new
   project and view your saved projects.

.. admonition:: Note

   The workspace shown above uses the "light" theme (dark text on a white background). If you prefer the reverse (light text on a black
   background), click the gear icon and select the "dark" theme.  

.. figure:: figures/replit-forking.png
   :alt: Replit.com how to copy/fork someone elses repl   

   **Fork button**: If you are viewing someone elses project, you can *fork*
   the content and store a copy of that project to your own account. This
   allows you to edit the files without changing the originals, and it lets
   you use other programmers' work (with permission) to enhance your own.  

.. figure:: figures/replit-edit_in_workspace.png
   :alt: Replit.com why you don't want to press edit in workspace button  

   You may notice the Edit in workspace button and think thats what you want.  However the following warning will pop up. Again, you want your own copy and to *fork* the repl!
  

Try It!
-------

Repeat your ``Hello, World!`` program in the editor. Replit.com automatically
saves your work, so your changes should not be lost when you logout or
refresh the page.

At any time, you can return to a list of your saved projects by clicking on the
menu bars next to your username and selecting *My Repls*.
