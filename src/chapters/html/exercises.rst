Exercises: HTML
===============

.. admonition:: Note

   If your teacher added you to a :ref:`repl.it classroom <replit-classroom-assignments>`
   or a :ref:`Trinket course <trinket-course-assignments>`, login to your
   account to access the starter code for each exercise.

   If you are NOT enrolled in a repl.it classroom or Trinket course, use one of
   the following links to copy the starter code.

   .. todo:: Insert links to the LCHS Trinket and repl.it starter code files.

Part 1: Add a Few Elements
--------------------------

Complete an HTML file for a simple web page. Add lines to ``index.html`` that
do the following:

#. Add an ``h1`` to the page that says "Why I Love Web Development".
#. Add an ordered list to the page. It should include 3 items that describe
   why you are excited about web development.
#. Add a paragraph about the first web page you want to make (or have already
   made) with your web development superpowers!
#. Add a link to an external website below your paragraph.

This code block gives you a rough outline for how it might look.

.. sourcecode:: html
   :linenos:

   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
      <head>
      </head>
      <body>
         <!-- h1 goes here --->
         <!-- ol goes here --->
         <!-- p goes here --->
         <!-- a goes here --->
      </body>
   </html>

.. admonition:: Note

   The starter code contains other HTML inside of the ``head`` element that you
   do not need to modify. Just add code for this exercise, NOT delete!

   In addition, when clicking on your link to make sure it works, right-click
   to open in a new tab!

Part 2: Organize the Elements
-----------------------------

Intro text leading to ideas:

#. Place the h1 element in a ``header`` element. Add follow-up text to expand
   the heading... (Subheadings or a paragraph).
#. Wrap the ol and p in a section element. Wrap ol in article and add a p or
   two. Wrap p in another article. Include a ul for items you will include on
   your personal page.
#. Wrap a in another section. Add a heading called "Favorite websites". Add
   more links. If want to be fancy, convert these into list items.
#. Add a ``footer`` element with "Created for {school_name} {class_name} on
   ____". Fill in the blanks with the name of your school, the name of your
   programming class, and the date, respectively...

Part 3: Add Attributes
----------------------

Lorem ipsum...

Part 4: Other Semantic Tags

Lorem ipsum...

``details`` element...

``sub`` and ``sup`` elements...

Maybe the ``blockquote`` element...
