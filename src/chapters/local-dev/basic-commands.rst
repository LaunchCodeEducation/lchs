When working with a relative path, you may find yourself wanting to go up
into a parent directory to find a file in a different sub, or child, directory.
In order to do so, you can use ``..`` in the file path to tell the computer to
go up to the parent directory.

Say ``hello.py`` is in a different directory called ``Projects``.
``Projects`` is inside the ``Desktop`` directory. Your current directory is
``LCHS_Homework``. In this scenario, we would use the ``..`` syntax in our
relative path. The relative path would then be ``/../Projects`` for Mac users 
and ``\..\Projects`` for Windows users.
