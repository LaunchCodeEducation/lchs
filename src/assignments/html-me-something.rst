Assignment #4: HTML Me Something
=================================

Youâ€™ve learned a bit of HTML and some CSS as you added or modified content in
exercises or pre-existing files. In this assignment, you are going to take the
next step by building an entire page from scratch!

There are two parts to this assignment, one focused on HTML and another on CSS.
HTML makes up the *structure and content* of web pages, while CSS sets the
*visual style*.

As a best practice, developers often keep the *content* and *style* as separate
as possible. With this in mind, you will build the HTML portion of your page
first. In the second half, you will add styling to the page with CSS.

.. admonition:: Tip

    Try to avoid using HTML tags to change the general appearance of your
    pages! For example, what if you want all of your main headings to be *red*?
    You can either add this style one time in the CSS file, or you must include
    ``style="color:red"`` in EVERY ``h1`` tag.

    Especially for large websites, CSS provides the best place to
    control the overall appearance of a page.
