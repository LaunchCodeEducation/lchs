Your First Flask App
====================

A Flask application is just a Python program. However, we need to organize our
code in a very specific way, and we need to learn some new syntax.

Initial Code
------------

In the ``hello_flask`` directory, create a new Python file called ``hello.py``.
Next, paste this code into the file, then save. We'll discuss what each line
does in a moment.

.. todo:: Insert Python starter code for first Flask app.

Launch the App
--------------

Lorem ipsum...

Activate Flask ---> run Python program (start server) ---> open port in the
browser.

Try changing the Python code. Refresh the page vs. stopping/restarting the
server. Explain what's going on.

Add random number to the output displayed on the page.

Routes
^^^^^^

Add a second page with different text.

Add Some HTML
-------------

Replace simple text with HTML enclosed in quotes. Note that this renders as
normal HTML on the page!

Render first simple form: Use a button as only element inside a form. Pushing
the button just changes the random number, since all it does is refreshes the
page.

Try It!
-------

Add a third page to the Python code. Update the route to check the page.
