Classes
=======

Let's return to the ``type()`` function for a moment. It returns the data type
for the argument inside the parentheses, and we can print this information to
the console.

.. admonition:: Try It!

   Run the program and examine the output. Feel free to change any of the
   arguments inside the parentheses ``()``.

   [insert repl here]

Note how the ``int`, ``str``, and ``list`` data types all get reported as a
``class``.

.. index:: ! class

As we saw before, all string values share a set of *properties* and *methods*,
while lists share a different set. When two data values share a set of
properties and methods, we say they belong to the same **class**.

Weâ€™ve already seen classes like ``str``, ``int``, ``float`` and Turtle. These
were defined by Python and made available for us to use.

.. admonition:: Example

   .. sourcecode:: Python

      print(type(dog))
