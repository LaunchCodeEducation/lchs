HTML Tags

Time to dive into all the different tags for organizing content! This page
contains a helpful table of tags for beginning programmers. *Tip*: Bookmark

This is NOT a complete list of all HTML tags, but it is a good place to start.
If you are interested in exploring other tags on your own,
`W3Schools <https://www.w3schools.com/tags/>`__ provides a longer, interactive
list.

.. admonition:: Note

   There are multiple headings in HTML going from ``h1`` to ``h6``.
   The headings get progressively smaller.
   A good rule of thumb is to have only one ``h1`` in a web page and do not skip a level.
   Headings can be resized so there is no need to do so.

Tag Example
-----------

Here is an example of a basic web page utilizing some of the tags above with
the HTML used to make the site.

.. sourcecode:: html
   :linenos:

   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
      <head>
         <title>Plant-Loving Astronauts</title>
      </head>
      <body>
         <h1>Space Plants Are Cool</h1>
         <p>NASA discovers that plants can live in <b>outer space</b>. More innovations from this discovery to follow.</p>
         <!-- add images from NASA of these space plants -->
      </body>
    </html>

.. figure:: figures/plant-loving-astronauts.png
   :alt: A web page with the heading, Space Plants Are Cool, and the paragraph about NASA's discovery of space plants.

Attributes
----------

.. index:: ! attribute

Programmers can add extra information beyond element type to HTML tags.
Programmers add **attributes** to HTML tags for further specification about the
element's appearance. Examples of attributes include the alignment of the
element or alternate text to an image.

Programmers add attributes before the closing bracket in the opening tag, like
so:

.. sourcecode:: html

   <element attribute = "value">content</element>

Attributes Example
------------------

Here is an example of a basic web page utilizing some of the tags above and
appropriate attributes with the HTML used to make the site.

.. sourcecode:: html
   :linenos:

   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
      <head>
         <title>Plant-Loving Astronauts</title>
      </head>
      <body>
         <h1>Space Plants Are Cool</h1>
         <p>NASA discovers that plants can live in <b>outer space</b>. More innovations from this discovery to follow.</p>
         <img src = "space-flower.jpg" alt = "Flower floating in space.">
         <!-- This image was taken by NASA and is in the Public Domain -->
      </body>
    </html>

.. figure:: figures/plant-loving-astronauts-2.png
   :alt: A web page with the heading, Space Plants Are Cool, and the paragraph about NASA's discovery of space plants with an accompanying picture of a flower floating in space.

The ``<img>`` tag has two attributes that you will see a lot. ``src`` gives the
location of the image that is being used and ``alt`` gives alternate text for
screen reader users. For that reason, ``alt`` should be a concise description
of what is going on in the image.
