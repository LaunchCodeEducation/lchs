Introduction
============

Welcome to the end of LaunchCode's LCHS course! In this chapter, we will use
our Python, web development, and database skills to build a game application.
Each of the following pages includes a video tutorial, sample code, and a text
summary for one piece of the project.

The goal is to build a bare-bones Minesweeper game. Consider this a prototype
for a more refined program. By the end of the chapter, we will have a working
game, but it will contain a few gaps and rough edges. Repeated playing of the
game will identify improvements that *could* be made, but these won't prevent
the app from operating.

Once you have your prototype up and running, feel free to make changes and add
different features to make the project your own!

The video clip below demonstrates what the finished project will look like. It
also provides game instructions for those who might not be familiar with how to
play Minesweeper.
