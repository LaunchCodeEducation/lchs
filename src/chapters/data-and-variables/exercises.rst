Exercises: Variables and Data Types
===================================

Exercises appear regularly in the book. Just like the concept checks, the
exercises check your understanding of the topics in this chapter. They
also provide good practice for the new skills.

Part A
------

Use the code editor at the end of this part to complete the following tasks:

#. Add parenthesis to the expression ``6 * 1 - 2`` to change its value from
   ``4`` to ``-6``.
#. The expression ``2 + 8 + 10 / 5`` evaluates to ``12.0``. Add parentheses to
   change the result to ``4.0``. How could you get a result of ``5.6``?
#. Assign a string to the variable ``word``.

   a. Print the word 4 times on the same line, with spaces between each
      - ``word word word word``.
   b. Using a single ``print`` statement, display this:

      ::

         wordword
         wordword
         wordword

   c. Using any number of ``print`` statements, display this:

      ::

         word     word     word
         word     word     word
         word     word     word

      Note that each ``word`` is separated by a tab, not a space.
