Create the Game Page
====================

Game board with active buttons. Similar to home page display, but add logic

Also, add New Game menu and Flag Mine functionality.

Add code to main.py to render the template.

Discuss different format for the form. Each *button* serves as an input, rather
than creating the usual ``input`` elements/fields.
