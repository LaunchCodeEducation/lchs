Using This Book
===============

Throughout this book, you will find different types of practice exercises. Each
one gives you a quick way to review or practice coding. To get the most out of
the book, try ALL of the tasks.

Concept Checks
--------------

Many pages end with a *Check Your Understanding*. This section contains a few
quick questions, and you should use them to measure your understanding of what
you just read.

The concept check questions are partially interactive---you can often click on
your chosen answer(s) to see if you are correct. However, your choices are NOT
saved. Leaving or refreshing the page erases the results.

If you want to save your answers, we recommend keeping a notebook where you can
write down the questions/answers that you find the most important or
interesting.

Try It!
^^^^^^^

Answer the following practice questions:

.. admonition:: Question

   Multiple choice: Select the correct option!

   .. raw:: html

      <script type="text/JavaScript">
         function evaluateMC(id, correct) {
            if (correct) {
               document.getElementById(id).innerHTML = 'Yep!';
               document.getElementById(id).style.color = 'blue';
            } else {
               document.getElementById(id).innerHTML = 'Nope!';
               document.getElementById(id).style.color = 'red';
            }
         }
      </script>
      <ol type="a">
         <li><input type="radio" name="Q1" autocomplete="off" onclick="evaluateMC(name, true)"> <strong>Pick this answer!!!</strong></li>
         <li><input type="radio" name="Q1" autocomplete="off" onclick="evaluateMC(name, false)"> Don't choose this answer.</li>
         <li><input type="radio" name="Q1" autocomplete="off" onclick="evaluateMC(name, false)"> Don't choose this answer either.</li>
         <li><input type="radio" name="Q1" autocomplete="off" onclick="evaluateMC(name, false)"> I insist on losing this point.</li>
      </ol>
      <p id="Q1"></p>

Examples
--------

Examples are times when we tie a concept we have just learned to a potential
real world application.

The label "Try It" signals an example that includes code you can modify and
augment to quickly reinforce what you have just read. Play around with these!

.. index:: ! repl.it

Repl.it
^^^^^^^

Many examples have links to **Repl.it**. This website allows you to write and
run practice code. Repl.it accounts are free, so we encourage you to
`sign up for one <https://repl.it/signup>`__.

As you explore the prepared examples in this book, feel free to make changes to
the code. If you want to save your edits, click the *Fork* button at the top of
the workspace, and Repl.it will store a copy of the code in your personal
account.


JavaScript in Context
---------------------

Our approach is different from other ways you can learn JavaScript.
The book focuses on programming fundamentals.
These fundamentals are problem-solving and transferable concepts.
While we will cover the exact way to perform certain tasks in JavaScript, we
want to remind you that these tasks are relatively common and many programming
languages have ways to carry them out.
