The Way of the Program
======================

   "It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the navicomputer."
   - Han Solo

.. index:: ! program

Given a set of inputs, Han's computer analyzes the data and returns information
about safely navigating a hyperspace jump. The computer does this by running a
**program**.

At the most basic level, a *program* is a set of instructions that tell a
computer or other machine what to do. These instructions consist of a set of
commands, calculations, and manipulations that achieve a specific result.
However, the computer cannot solve the problem on its own. Someone---a
programmer---had to figure out a series of steps for the computer to follow.
Also, the programmer had to write these steps in a way the computer can
understand.
