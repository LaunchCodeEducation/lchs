Exercises: Git More Practice
============================

Working with a Local Repository
-------------------------------

Use your terminal powers to move through these Git exercises.

#. Launch Visual Studio Code and open the terminal pane.
#. In your ``local_practice`` folder, make a new directory called
   ``Git-Exercises``. Go to *File --> Open* and select this new folder.
#. In the terminal, make sure that you are in the ``Git-Exercises`` directory.
   Initialize it as a new repository with ``git init``.
#. Add a file called ``exercises.txt`` using the ``touch`` command in the terminal.
#. Commit your local changes using the ``git commit`` procedures.
#. Add "Hello World!" to the file called ``exercises.txt``.
#. Commit your local changes following the same steps that you used for step 4.
#. View and screenshot the result when you use ``git log``. Make note of what you see!

Setting up a Github Account
---------------------------

For our remote repositories, we will be using `GitHub <https://github.com/>`__. 

To create your account, follow these steps:

#. Navigate to GitHub's site using the link above.
#. Sign up for an account on the homepage either by filling out the form or clicking the "Sign Up" button.
#. Once you have an account, you are ready to store your remote work.
