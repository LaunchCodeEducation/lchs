Navigating Commits
==================

Lorem ipsum...

``git log`` displays a log of every commit in the repository.

If the steps above are followed correctly, the programmer will find their
latest commit at the top of the log.

``git log`` shows the author of the commit, the date made, the comment, and a
40-character hash. This hash or value is a key for Git to refer to the version.
Programmers use these hashes to reference specific commits, or snapshots, in
the repository's history.
