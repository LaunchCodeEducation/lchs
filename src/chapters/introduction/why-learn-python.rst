Why Python?
===========

Most programmers have a favorite coding language, but there is NOT a single,
best choice. Each language does some things very well, other things pretty well, and
a few things not so well.

For most tasks, any programming language will do the job. Which one you use
depends on convenience and personal preference. So why start with Python?

Python Is A Friendly First Language

Take a look at the following code samples, which select a random number and
then print it to the screen.

Python Makes it Easier to Learn Other Languages
-----------------------------------------------

Once you learn how to code something in Python---like printing to the screen
or asking the user for input---you will recognize the same tasks when they
appear in Java, C++, JavaScript, etc. Even though the structure of the
languages might be unfamiliar, you will still be able to tell *what* the code
is doing.

This course is different from other ways you can learn Python. It focuses on
programming *fundamentals* and *thinking like a coder*. These skills apply to
ALL programming languages. Once you learn them for Python, you will be able to
reuse those skills when you switch to a different language.

The logic and problem-solving techniques necessary to write programs are
standard. We will teach you how to *code*. Python is simply the tool we use to
do it.
