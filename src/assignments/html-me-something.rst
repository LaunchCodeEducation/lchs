Assignment #4: HTML Me Something
=================================

You’ve learned a bit of HTML and some CSS as you added or modified content in
exercises or pre-existing files. In this assignment, you are going to take the
next step by building an entire page from scratch!

There are two parts to this assignment, one focused on HTML and another on CSS.
HTML makes up the *structure and content* of web pages, while CSS sets the
*visual style*.

As a best practice, developers often keep the content and style as separate as
possible. With this in mind, you will build the HTML portion of your page
first. In the second half, you will add styling to the page with CSS.

.. admonition:: Tip

   Try to avoid using HTML tags to change the general appearance of your
   pages! For example, what if you want all of your section headings to be
   *red*? You can either add this style one time in the CSS file, or you must
   include ``style="color:red"`` in EVERY ``h2`` tag.

   Especially for large websites, CSS provides the best place to
   control the overall appearance of a page.

Getting started
----------------

Login to your `Trinket <https://trinket.io/login>`__ or `repl.it <https://repl.it/login>`__
account. Open a new HTML/CSS project and call it ``HTML Me Something``.

Repl.it Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you open a new HTML project, repl.it gives you some boilerplate code:

.. sourcecode:: HTML
   :linenos:

   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
      <head>
         <meta charset="utf-8">
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
         <title>repl.it</title>
         <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
      </head>
      <body>
         <script src="script.js"></script>
      </body>
   </html>

This is a good starting place, but you should make some minor tweaks before
diving into Part 1.

#. Change the ``title`` text on line 6 to describe the page you want to build.
#. Remove the ``script`` element from line 10.
#. You can also delete ``script.js`` from the file tree on the left hand side
   of the workspace.

You're good to go!

Trinket Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After naming your new HTML project, you will see an empty editor. Before
starting Part 1, do the following:

#. Paste in the same repl.it code shown above. Also, make the first two minor
   tweaks.
#. In the toolbar above the editor panel, click the ``+`` button to add a new
   file. Name this file ``style.css``.

You're ready to go!

.. _html-me-part1:

Part 1: HTML
------------

In Part 1, you will build the structure and content for your webpage. All of
your work for this part will go inside the ``body`` element of the
``index.html`` file.

Getting to Work
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Your mission is to build a page that:

#. Tells a story. This can be personal or impersonal, funny, serious or
   neither. You can do whatever you like, but it should be something in the
   range of 3-10 paragraphs or sections. `Here is an example
   <http://education.launchcode.org/html-me-something/submissions/chrisbay/index-nocss.html>`__,
   and here are some other ideas:

   a. Describe a trip you took.
   b. Talk about one of your hobbies or passions.
   c. Create a page that provides an alternate ending to a book you read. (For
      example: *The Hunger Games* trilogy, Prim, go...)

#. Does each of the following:

   a. Uses each of the following structural HTML5 tags: ``<p>``,
      ``<header>``, ``<footer>``, ``<main>``, ``<article>``. If you need
      to review any of these tags, check out the `HTML tag reference
      <http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp>`__ at W3Schools.
   b. Uses at least one ``<img>`` tag (hopefully more). (See note below).
   c. Uses at least one `HTML entity
      <http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp>`__. Hint: putting a
      copyright notice in your footer will afford you the opportunity to use
      ``&copy;``, but you should also try to get creative here.
   d. Demonstrates creativity. Don’t stop with these items or tags. Have some
      ideas for your page, and make it great. And dig into the
      `w3schools HTML reference <http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp>`__
      to learn more about other tags, their usage and attributes!

Tips
^^^^

#. Right-click on the `the example page <http://education.launchcode.org/html-me-something/submissions/chrisbay/index-nocss.html>`__
   to learn how your HTML elements might be structured.
   
   However, do NOT just copy/paste! Build your page to fit your own content.
#. Don’t add any CSS yet. Really, we mean it! If you think your page
   looks boring now, that’s okay. You will fix that soon enough.
#. Rely on the reference sites linked on this page, or find others online. We
   haven’t taught you every detail about every tag that you may want or need.
#. You’re free to use tags that haven’t been introduced in class! We’ve given
   you enough background to get started, but you are more than ready to do
   some learning on your own.
