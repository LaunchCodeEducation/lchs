Exercises: Dictionaries
=======================

If your teacher uses a repl.it or Trinket *classroom*, follow the links in your
account to access the starter code file.

If you are NOT enrolled in either type of classroom, use the editors below to
complete the exercises.

Part A: Search a Dictionary
---------------------------

The ``flavors`` dictionary contains entries that pair different ice cream
flavors with their cost per scoop. Your job is to do the following:

#. Write a function that searches the dictionary for a particular flavor and
   returns its cost.
#. Write a function that returns the key name for the most expensive choice
   in the ``flavors`` dictionary.

Part B: Keys from Collections
-----------------------------

Use the accumulator pattern to add new keys to an empty dictionary.

#. Write a function that takes each entry from the ``names`` list and creates a
   key in the ``ticket_holders`` dictionary.
#. For the value of each key, choose a random integer from 100-500.

   .. admonition:: Tip

      We are not worried about repeated ticket numbers in this exercise, but
      if you are interested in preventing ticket problems, 

Use the characters in a string or elements in a list to create the keys in a
new dictionary.

Part C: Assign Values to Keys
-----------------------------

Select random items from a string or list and assign them as values to the keys
in a dictionary.

If value is at string and a number, convert to int data type...

Part D: Assign Key/Value Pairs
------------------------------

Character counts... 

Part E: Loop Through a Dictionary
---------------------------------

Iterate by keys, values, and items. Print only if a condition is met.

Extract a keys list to print in alphabetical order...
