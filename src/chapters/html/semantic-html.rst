HTML Writing Style
------------------

Programmers write HTML different ways with different style guides and philosophies.
**Semantic HTML** is not about the appearance of the web page, but about the specific meaning of the elements.
Semantic HTML helps programmers communicate through code and may be easier to pick up at first.
Programmers can make a paragraph larger than a heading.
But by looking at the HTML, another programmer can understand which is the paragraph and which is the heading.
Another benefit to semantic HTML is that it is easier for beginning programmers to visualize the end results.
Some examples of semantic HTML tags are: ``<p>``, ``<h1>``, ``<h2>`` , and ``<div>``.

.. admonition:: Reminder

   Making code work is important and so is making it easier for other programmers to read.
   Not every piece of code a programmer reads is something they wrote.
