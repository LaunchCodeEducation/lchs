Create a Class
==============

What Classes Do
---------------

We often create many objects of the same type, like a series of whole numbers
or string values. Classes allow us to do this in an efficient way.

Think of classes like cookie cutters. They provide the structure for making
multiple examples of the same data type, and they make sure each object can
execute the same methods. We reuse a class every time we need to generate a new
object.

.. admonition:: Note

   Although classes create new objects, the objects themselves will NOT be
   exactly the same. For example, all string values have a *length*, but the
   *value* for the length depends on the number of characters in each string.

   Objects of the same type have the same property names and methods. However,
   the values of the properties can differ.

   Think of this like using the same cookie cutter to make sugar cookies vs.
   gingerbread cookies. Each cookie will have *color* and *flavor* properties,
   but these will have completely different values depending on the recipe.

Let's revisit the ``dog`` object we used earlier to see how it relates to a
class.

   Classes let us create multiple, similar objects.

Each object contains the same property names, and each one can execute the same
set of methods. The three objects all belong to the same class, even though
their property values differ.

Defining a New Class
--------------------

Before we create a new class, we must begin by describing the objects that
belong in that class. We must take time to think about the properties and
methods we want each object to have. Next, *we write them down*! Doing this
will help make designing and coding the class much easier.
