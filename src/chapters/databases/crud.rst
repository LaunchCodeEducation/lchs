Database Operations
===================

For this course, we are not going to create or access a large-scale database.
Instead, we will mimic the behavior of a database by creating a file in our
project directory. This file will contain all the necessary tables, and we will
use it to store and access information.

Before we set up our first database, we need to recognize the four main actions
we will perform with it.

CRUD
----

.. index:: ! query, ! CRUD

.. index::
   single: SQL; query
   single: SQL; CRUD

When we perform an operation on a database, we write a **query**. Queries can
be simple or complex, depending on the task. We can fit each queryâ€™s purpose
into one of four categories:

#. Create
#. Read
#. Update
#. Delete

Taking the first letter from each category gives is the term **CRUD**. Let's
look at each type of operation in more detail.

Create
------

When we talk about *creating* something in a database, this can mean adding a
new table, a new row, or a new column.

Adding a Table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Lorem ipsum...

Command must include the table name. Also, must include the name and data type
for each column.

Adding a Row
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Lorem ipsum...

Command will insert a row into the table. Command can include values for every
column or just selected columns.

Adding a Column
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Lorem ipsum...

Does NOT mean adding a data value to every entry currently in the table.
Instead, the entries will record an empty space, called ``NULL``.
