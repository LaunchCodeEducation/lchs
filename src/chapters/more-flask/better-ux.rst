The User Experience
===================

.. index:: ! UI, ! UX

The term **user interface** (UI) refers to the buttons, windows, icons, etc.
that a human interacts with when they use a device.

   Three UI examples: a command line prompt, a clickable file tree, and a touch-sensitive home screen.

**User experience** (UX) refers to the emotions a person feels as they interact
with an application or device. The better the experience, the more likely they
are to keep using it.

Good developers pay close attention to both UI and UX. Often, the two ideas go
hand in hand. However, they are NOT the same thing. For example, here's a
relatively simple user interface:

.. figure:: figures/simple-ui.jpg

   The UI controls how the user interacts with the device.

This design is efficient, easy to understand, and effective. Now, take that
same UI and apply it in two slightly different ways. This gets us to the user
experience. Can you identify which setup provides the better UX?

   UX deals with how the user feels about using the device.

Flask gives us the tools to make a decent UI, like the page navigation menu we
created on the previous page. However, a solid UI doesn't guarantee a good UX.
For example, the navigation menu appears below any HTML inserted into the base
template. Since each page has a different amount of content, the location of
the menu changes after we click a link. This provides a poor UX.

.. admonition:: Try It!

   What steps can we take to improve the users' experience with the navigation
   menu? Try out a few ideas, then demo them for your teacher and/or
   classmates.

A poor user interface often leads directly to a bad user experience. However, a
good UI may lead to an excellent, good, average, or poor UX.

Each of the following images gives an example of a poor user experience.
However, the user interface itself might be just fine.

.. admonition:: Question

   Study each picture and decide if the UX problem comes from a poor user
   interface or a faulty implementation of a working UI.

   Once you make your decision, click on the options below to check your
   thinking.

   .. raw:: html

      <ol type="a">
         <li onclick="revealAnswer('resultA', 'Poor UI')">Figure 1 <span id="resultA"></span></li>
         <li onclick="revealAnswer('resultB', 'Working UI, faulty implementation')">Figure 2 <span id="resultB"></span></li>
         <li onclick="revealAnswer('resultC', 'Poor UI')">Figure 3 <span id="resultC"></span></li>
         <li onclick="revealAnswer('resultD', 'Poor UI')">Figure 4 <span id="resultD"></span></li>
         <li onclick="revealAnswer('resultE', 'Working UI, faulty implementation')">Figure 5 <span id="resultE"></span></li>
         <li onclick="revealAnswer('resultF', 'Working UI, faulty implementation')">Figure 6 <span id="resultF"></span></li>
      </ol>

.. Answers: Poor UI = a, c, d. Working UI, poor implementation = b, e, f.
