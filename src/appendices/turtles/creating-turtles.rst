Creating Turtles
================

Letâ€™s write some lines of Python code to create a new turtle and make it draw a
single line.

Just like a library holds hundreds of books that we can check out, the
``turtle`` module contains all the information we need to make our drawings.
Before we can use this information, however, we need to add it to our program.

.. sourcecode:: Python
   :linenos:

   import turtle

The keyword ``import`` tells Python to find a file called ``turtle`` and pull
in all of its information.

A New Turtle Object
-------------------

We will refer to our first turtle using the variable name alex,
but remember that you can choose any name you wish as long as you follow the
naming rules from the previous chapter.

The program as shown will only draw the first two sides of the rectangle. After
line 4 you will have a straight line going from the center of the drawing
canvas towards the right. After line 6, you will have a canvas with a turtle
and a half drawn rectangle. Press the run button to try it and see.
