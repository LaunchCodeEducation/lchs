Activity #3: Making Diamonds
============================

One good way to solve large problems is to split them into smaller tasks. With
code, these smaller pieces are solved by writing *functions*. We can then take
the results from each function and combine them to complete the bigger task.

To master functions, you need to write a *lot* of them.

In this activity, you will write lots of small functions and combine their
output. By the end, you will create "shape strings", like this nifty diamond:

.. sourcecode:: bash

       #
      ###
     #####
    #######
   #########
   #########
    #######
     #####
      ###
       #

Part 1: Warm Up (Lines, Rectangles, and Squares)
------------------------------------------------

In this part, you will write a few small functions to draw some simple shapes
in the console. You will also practice calling one function from inside another
one.
