The User Experience
===================

.. index:: ! UI, ! UX

The term **user interface** (UI) refers to the buttons, windows, icons, etc.
that a human interacts with when they use a device.

   Three UI examples: a command line prompt, a clickable file tree, and a touch-sensitive home screen.

**User experience** (UX) refers to the emotions a person feels as they interact
with an application or device. Good developers pay close attention to both UI
and UX. The better the experience, the more likely people are to keep using
the products.

Often, UI and UX go hand in hand. However, they are NOT the same thing. For
example, here's a relatively simple user interface:

   [TP in holder image]

(Caption: UI is how the user interacts with the device.)

Now take that same UI and apply it in two slightly different ways. This is an
example of user experience:

   [TP holder in and out of reach]

(Caption: UX is how the user feels about using the device.)
