Bootstrap
=========

CSS allows us to make our webpages attractive. For larger sites or more complex
pages, the amount of CSS code can get quite large. Fortunately, we don't have
to reinvent the wheel every time we create a page.

If we save some of our favorite style rules in a single ``.css`` file, we can
reuse that code for multiple pages. Similarly, many developers are willing to
share their CSS rules with others. With their permission, we can import their
work to decorate our own HTML.

What is Bootstrap
-----------------

Bootstrap provides a library of ready-made CSS that we can use to quickly make
our web pages look more professional.
