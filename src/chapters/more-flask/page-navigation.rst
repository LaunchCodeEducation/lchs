Page Navigation
===============

So far, we've used the address bar in the browser to access each webpage we've
built. Obviously, we need to do better than this. Users shouldn't have to type
in the address for every page they want to visit!

Adding links that connect to other pages in our website makes navigation much
easier. These links can take many forms, like a simple list of clickable URLs,
a set of icons, *Next Page* and *Previous Page* buttons, a dropdown menu, or a
nav bar. (You can find several of these options on this very page!)

A List of Links
---------------

Lorem ipsum...

Add ul with one list item for each page in the website...

Bring in Some Logic
-------------------

Update code to use a ``for`` loop to populate the list of links. A global
variable will be required in ``main.py``.

Change to a ``select`` Menu
---------------------------

Lorem ipsum...

This will keep the size of the menu consistent as our website grows!

Navigation Bar and Other Options
--------------------------------

Check Bootstrap (navbar option)... Down the rabbit hole!

GIF of Next and Back buttons...

This is beyond the scope of this course...
