The ``random`` Module
=====================

We often want to use random numbers in programs. Here are a few typical uses:

#. To play a game where the computer needs to throw some dice, pick a number,
   or flip a coin.
#. To select a random item from a list.
#. To randomly choose an event to apply to a virtual city.
#. To encrypt your banking session on the Internet.

Python provides a module called ``random`` that helps with tasks like this.
