Redirecting
===========

Lorem ipsum...

Demo render template moving to a different page. Note that the web address
stays the same, but the "page" itself is different. (This isn't a good idea).

Compare to what a link does. Also, action attribute in a form tag...

Redirect sends users to a different path...

Can send limited data with the redirect, just like with render template...

Idea behind redirect: *Go over there now*. Idea behind render template:
*You're in the right spot, now look at this*...

Redirect codes (GET vs. POST)...

Add GET/POST check. Redirect on GET (to prevent users from just entering the
URL in the address bar). We'll learn a more secure way to do this later in the
course. This is a crude way of adding security, and it is far from perfect. We
really need a way of checking if the user is logged in *before the page loads*.
