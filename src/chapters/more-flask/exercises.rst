Exercises: Flask
================

Possible exercise ideas:

#. Create a task list. Students must create code to display the list
   (single page), add items to it, and remove items.
#. Add conditionals to a template to display different content based on answers
   to questions?

   a. Same page, divided into thirds/fourths?
   b. Choose Your Own Adventure update? Move saved console code to web display?

      - For loop to display choices?

#. Update pizza topping website to display running total for selected options?
   Second page for beverage choices?
#. Design a form? (Loop to populate it with input boxes. How to bring in
   conditionals?)
#. Progressive-content webpage (with form). As user submits the form, display
   different text?
#. Follow decision tree: Show graphic (one of several possible) with current
   location marked. Display form with T/F choices (loop). Update image, text,
   and form(?) with each submission. Will need to provide working Python code?
   Tasks = applying Jinja2 logic (loop, if/else, extend).

   a. Clone starter code from GitHub.
   b. Launch main.py.
   c. Extend base.
   d. Replace input box HTML with Jinja2 loop.
   e. Wrap image HTML inside Jinja2 conditional.
   f. Add a *Reset* and/or *Up One Level* button? Have these in the starter
      code and ask the students to add a conditional (buttons should NOT
      appear initially).
