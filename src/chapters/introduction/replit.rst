Repl.it
=======

`Repl.it <https://repl.it>`__ is a free online code editor, and it provides a
practice space to boost your programming skills.

For this class, repl.it serves two purposes:

#. To provide opportunities to respond to prompts, questions, and "Try It"
   exercises embedded within the reading.
#. To hold larger exercises and studios that will be checked for accuracy and
   tracked for completion.

Repl.it Account Creation

complete the general practice tasks.

To access the tracked and scored tasks, students must also enroll in a repl.it
*classroom*. A link to join the classroom will be provided as part of an early
Canvas assignment.
