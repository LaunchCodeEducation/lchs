Your First Python Program
=========================

Traditionally, the first program written in a new language is called
``Hello, World!`` because all it does is display the words, *Hello, World!* on
the screen. In Python, the source code looks like this.

.. sourcecode:: Python

   print("Hello, World!")

.. index:: ! print function

This is an example of using the **print function**, which doesn’t actually
print anything on paper. It displays a value on the screen. In this case, the
result is the phrase:

::

   Hello, World!

Try It!
^^^^^^^

Type ``print("Hello, World!")`` into the code editor below, then click the
green *Run* button.

.. admonition:: Warning

   Do NOT just copy/paste the code. You will learn best by typing, trying,
   changing, and fixing.

.. raw:: html

   <iframe height="400px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@launchcode/LCHS-Hello-World?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>

The quotation marks inside the parentheses () mark the beginning and end of the
value to display. They don’t appear in the result.

Some people judge the quality of a programming language by the simplicity of
the ``Hello, World!`` program. By this standard, Python does very well.

.. admonition:: Note

   If you typed correctly, you saw the output ``Hello, World!`` If you left out
   or mistyped any characters, then you either saw a misspelled output or an
   error message. Do not worry if you make mistakes! These experiences still
   teach you something. Fix any errors and try again.

Now Play
^^^^^^^^^

Once you print ``Hello, World!`` successfully, go back and play around with the
code. Make a change, click *Run*, and see what happens. Try to:

#. Change the message printed.
#. Figure out what the parentheses do. Will the code work without them?
#. Remove one or both quotation marks. Do we need to include both *opening* and
   *closing* marks?
#. Is there a difference between using a single or a double quote (``'`` vs.
   ``"``)?
#. Print multiple messages one after the other.
#. Print two messages on the same line.
#. Print a number. (Bonus: Print two numbers added together).
#. Print a message that contains quote marks, such as ``You're`` or ``I can
   print, "Hello, World!"``.
#. Other. You choose!

Spend a few minutes trying these changes. Do not worry if you miss some of the
targets. Learning comes through experience, and you WILL learn all the details
behind ``print`` soon.

Once you finish practicing (and hopefully making some mistakes), you will have
a pretty good idea of how the ``print`` function in Python works.

.. admonition:: Try It

   On paper (or in a document on your computer), write one or two sentences about
   ``print``. You should provide more detail than, “It prints things.”

.. admonition:: Question

   The print function:

   #. sends information to the printer to be printed on paper.
   #. displays a value on the screen.
   #. tells the computer to put the information in print, rather than cursive,
      font.
   #. tells the computer to speak the information.

.. admonition:: Question

   Which of the following correctly prints ``Coding Rocks``? There may be more
   than one valid option!

   a. ``print(Coding Rocks)``
   b. ``print"Coding Rocks"``
   c. ``print('Coding Rocks')``
   d. ``print("Coding Rocks')``
   e. ``print("Coding Rocks")``
