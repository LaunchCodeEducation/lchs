Assignment #3: Console Game
===========================

You and a partner will design a simple console game app. For example:

#. Guess letters to figure out a word/sentence
#. Guess a 4 color sequence (a.k.a Mastermind)
#. 21
#. Global Thermonuclear War
#. etc.

For example...Rock, paper, scissors (in run-only editor).

Requirements
------------

**Your program must include**:

#. User input
#. At least one loop and one conditional
#. Functions
#. Lists
#. A ``main()`` function
#. Replay option (e.g. "Would you like to play again?")

**Bonus items**:

#. Using dictionaries
#. Using classes/objects
#. Using a module (custom or ready-made)

Choose an Idea
--------------

Talk to your partner. Brainstorm ideas. Describe to each other what you want
the program to do (NO CODE YET).  Discuss the GAME, not the Python.

Start simple! You have a limited amount of time, and you can always add more
complicated features later.

Write Down Some Pseudo-code
---------------------------

Define pseudo-code...

Provide example...

Get the Console App Working
---------------------------

Lorem ipsum...

#. What data/variables does it need? What sort of logic?
#. Code something small that works (NOT the whole game).
#. Add one small, new thing.  Keep the code working.
#. Add the next, tiny thing.  Keep the code working.
#. Keep this up until the console app is done.
