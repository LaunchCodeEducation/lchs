Exercises: Errors and Debugging
===============================

Programmers spend a lot of time reviewing other people's code to help them find
and fix bugs.

Assume you are part of a team, and you must get the following code samples
working. Do NOT just clear the editor and start from scratch! Part of working
well with others is to recognize their effort and what they did correctly.
Throwing away all of their code just because you would do it differently is NOT
a helpful strategy.

Find and Fix Syntax Errors
--------------------------

The following code sample contains 3 syntax errors.

#. Before making any changes, run the code as-is to generate the first error
   message.
#. Use the error message to fix the first bug. Do NOT change anything in the
   code unless it involves fixing the first bug.
#. After changing the code, run the program again. If there is another bug in
   the program, you will see a different error message.
#. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you fix all of the bugs and the program runs
   successfully.

.. admonition:: Example

   This program asks the user to enter an index value, and then it gives the
   letter from an alphabet string that has that index.

Find and Fix Runtime Errors
---------------------------

The following code sample contains 3 runtime errors.

#. Before making any changes, run the code as-is to generate the first error
   message.
#. Follow the same process you used above to fix the runtime errors. Note that
   syntax highlighting does NOT show all possible runtime errors.

Solve Logic Errors
------------------

#. The following code contains two logic errors.  When given a student's score
   on an exam, the program *should* convert the points earned into a
   percentage (points earned / points possible * 100). Find and fix the errors
   so that the program gives the correct result.

   .. admonition:: Example

      *Tip*: Use the following data to test the program and your fix.

      a. ``points_earned = 8``, ``points_possible = 10``, Correct answer =
         ``80.0%``
      b. ``points_earned = 11``, ``points_possible = 15``, Correct answer â‰ˆ
         ``73.33333333333333%``
      c. ``points_earned = 23.4``, ``points_possible = 25``, Correct answer =
         ``93.6%``

#. The next program should convert a student's exam percentage into a letter
   grade. The code follows a simple 10-point scale and allows for decimal
   results:

   A: 100% - 90%, B: 89 - 80, C: 79 - 70, D: 69 - 60, F: Any score under 60%.

   .. admonition:: Example

      Be sure to test all the *edge cases*. For example, 80% is a ``B``, but
      79.99...% is a ``C``.

#. The last code sample checks if a username is valid, but it's not working yet.
   Add ``print`` statements as directed to find and fix the logic errors.

   Username rules:

   a. Must be 5 - 10 characters long.
   b. Must only contain letters and numbers.
   c. Must contain at least 1 digit.

   Test names:

   a. ``"Me2"`` should be invalid (too short).
   b. ``"CoderGirl"`` should be invalid (no number).
   c. ``"rut*baga8"`` should be invalid (illegal symbol).
   d. ``"This1IsTooLong"`` should be invalid (too long).

   .. admonition:: Example

      ``print`` statement steps:

      #. Line 10...
      #. Correction hints...
      #. Line 18...
      #. Correction hints...
