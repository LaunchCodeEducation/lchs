Managing Cookies
================

Notes:

#. When the server creates a cookie on our browser, it can set a specific time
   for that data to expire. If no time is set, then the cookie gets erased when
   we quit the browser. Putting our device to sleep or closing the tab does NOT
   clear cookies!
#. For example, the "Remember me" checkbox found in login forms.
