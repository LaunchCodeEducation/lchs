Requirements
------------

To be considered complete, your program must include each of the following:

#. User input (to make the program interactive).
#. At least one loop and one conditional.
#. Two or more functions, one of which must be a ``main()`` function.
#. At least one list.
#. A replay option (e.g. "Would you like to play again?").

To boost your score for this assignment, you and your partner can include one
or more of the following **Bonus Items**:

#. Use one or more dictionaries in addition to (or in place of) the required
   lists.
#. Use classes/objects.
#. Use a module (custom or ready-made).

Choose an Idea
--------------

Before you start coding, you must decide WHAT you want to create!

#. Talk to your partner. Brainstorm ideas, and write them down.
#. Show the list of your ideas to your teacher. Receive feedback on which ones
   are suitable for the assignment.
#. Narrow down your list, then select the idea that excites you the most.

Next, describe to each other what you want the program to do. Now is NOT the
time to write code! Discuss the GAME, not the Python.

#. Write down the features you want your game to have.
#. Write down what information needs to be displayed in the console.
#. Start simple! You have a limited amount of time, and you can always add more
   complicated features later.

Outline the Program
-------------------

Define pseudo-code...

Provide example...

Get the Console App Working
---------------------------

Open a new project in Trinket or repl.it...

Lorem ipsum...

#. What data/variables does it need? What sort of logic?
#. Code something small that works (NOT the whole game).
#. Add one small, new thing.  Keep the code working.
#. Add the next, tiny thing.  Keep the code working.
#. Keep this up until the console app is done.

Expand Your Working Program
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Lorem ipsum...

Scoring
-------

Before you submit your final program, be sure that your code:

#. Works,
#. Includes your name and your partner's name,
#. Includes each of :ref:`the required items <assignment3-requirements>`,
#. Survives invalid input. For example, if your program asks the user to enter
   a number, it should not crash when they enter a letter.
#. Includes enough comments to describe what each part of the code is doing.
#. Follows proper Python naming conventions.

Your teacher will provide you with a detailed **rubric** for this assignment.
This describes how each part of the project will be graded, as well as how
many points each part can earn.

Submitting Your Work
--------------------

Your teacher will provide instructions for sharing the URL for your project.
