Repl.it Classrooms
==================

Repl.it *Classroom* provides students with the ability to create code and then
submit it to their teachers. It also allows teachers to post instructions and
set up automatic code checking.

Assignments in a classroom can only be accessed by people enrolled in the
course, and student work can only be seen by the instructors.

A repl.it classroom is used for:

#. Organizing coding tasks,
#. Completing and submitting ungraded, practice tasks,
#. Providing feedback for working or non-working code,
#. Submitting assignments for a grade.

.. admonition:: Tip

   You NEVER have to click *Save* in repl.it. The site automatically stores
   your code on their servers.

   However, you DO have to click *Submit* to turn in your work from a
   classroom.
