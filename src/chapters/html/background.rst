Background
==========

When programmers make websites, they want their pages to be beautiful,
interactive, and fun. Python allows us to control the logic for a website
behind the scenes, but it does not do much to define the structure and
appearance of a web page.

In the next two chapters, we will learn about HTML and CSS. These are the two
most common languages for organizing content and making it beautiful.

Before jumping in to learn HTML and CSS, we need to understand how web pages
appear on screens.

The Internet vs. The Web
------------------------

.. index:: ! internet, ! web, ! browser

The internet is a wire...

At various points, the wire branches off to connect to networks...

Each network is a set of devices connected to something that connects to the
wire... School, businesses, home network, phones, etc.

All of these different networks, connected together, form the **internet**.

The **World Wide Web** is one system we use to interact with the wire. There
are other options, but the web is the most common...

The web allows people all over the world to request and share information. We
usually access the web using **browsers**. Browsers let us request data from a
network and then view that content on our screen.

The internet is really just hardware and data---the machines and structures
that store and transmit information. The web is what we use to access those
machines and display the information in a useful way.

As long as two computers are connected to the same "wire", they can communicate
with each other over the internet. The web is simply one tool that makes
exchanging information easier.

Web Pages
---------

.. index:: ! server

The process involves the browser and the **server** that
hosts the code. Think of a server as a machine that stores the data related to
a particular page on the internet.

You are viewing this page in a browser. On the surface, browsers are the
tools that give us access to the internet. However, programmers think of
browsers a little differently. For them, the browser is what translates code
into a web page.

When you visit a web page in a browser, three main steps happen:

1. The browser sends a **request** to the server for the web page.
2. The server **responds** with the code that makes up the web page. 
3. The browser receives the code and executes it. This displays the web page
   in the browser window as .

When the browser renders the page, HTML outlines the structure of the page's
content.

.. admonition:: Note

   In later chapters, request and response between browsers and servers will be
   discussed in greater detail.
