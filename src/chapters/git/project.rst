Project: Git a Remote Repository
================================

In this activity, you are going to create a remote repository and practice
pushing changes to it from your local machine.

Create a New Local Repository
-----------------------------

#. Launch Visual Studio Code and open the terminal panel.
#. Navigate into the ``local_practice`` directory and create a new folder. You
   can name it whatever you want, but you will be reusing code from your
   :ref:`Turtle Races <turtle-races>` project.
#. Use the *File* menu to open the new folder in VS Code. In the terminal, use
   ``pwd`` to confirm that you are in the correct directory.
#. Use ``git init`` to initialize your project as a Git repository.
#. Move your ``turtle_race.py`` file into the directory. You an do this with
   terminal commands, or you can drag-and-drop the existing file into the
   folder.
#. Run ``turtle_race.py`` to confirm that it still works. If not, debug your
   program to get it running again.
#. Save and commit the changes.
#. Check the name of your default branch with the ``git branch`` command. If
   necessary, use ``git branch -m`` to change the name of the branch to
   ``main``.

.. admonition:: Note

   If you did not complete the Turtle Races project, no worries. Just add a
   new Python file to the repository. Code a simple ``print`` statement
   inside a loop and run with that.
