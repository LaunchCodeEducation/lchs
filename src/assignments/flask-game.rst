Assignment #6: Flask Game
=========================

In :ref:`Assignment #3 <console-game>`, you and a partner designed a simple
game app that ran in the console. This was a great step in creating your own
complete program from start to finish.

Now that you have some Flask experience, you can move your game out of the
console and into a browser!

.. admonition:: Example

   On the left is the same console Rock-Paper-Scissors example from Assignment
   3. The right hand side shows what it could look like in a browser.

   Insert screenshots, GIFS, or Trinket editor showing the differences between
   a console rock-paper-scissors game and a web-based one...

If your teacher didn't ask you to complete the :ref:`Console Game <console-game>`
assignment, you should review that page to get some ideas about how the game
needed to operate.

If you DID create a console game but want to create a different one for the
browser, that's fine! You are free to recycle an old idea or think up something
completely new. For example, maybe your teacher had you code a
choose-your-own-adventure program after chapter 5. Imagine what that would look
like on the web, with each choice updating the page or redirecting to a
different one.

.. _assignment6-requirements:

Requirements
------------

To be considered complete, your application must include each of the following:

#. A web form to collect user input.
#. At least two HTML templates, one of which can be a ``base.html`` file. These
   should include placeholders to display data that might change when the page
   reloads.
#. CSS styling, either from a local ``style.css`` file or from
   :ref:`Bootstrap <bootstrap-classes>`.
#. At least one Jinja2 loop or conditional within the template(s).
#. Includes both client-side and server-side validation.
#. Python code that:

   a. Renders the required templates,
   b. Collects user input from the web form,
   c. Creates, accesses, modifies, or deletes data from a Flask ``session``,
   d. Generates feedback messages for the user,
   e. Runs the game!

Part 1: Create a New GitHub Repository

Scoring
-------

Before you submit your application, be sure that it:

#. Works.
#. Is neither overly simple nor overly complex.
#. Meets each of the :ref:`project requirements <assignment6-requirements>`.
#. Survives invalid input. For example, if your program asks the user to enter
   a number, it should not crash when they enter a letter.
#. Includes enough comments to describe what each part of the code is doing.
#. Demonstrates skilled Python coding.
#. Is fun to play!

Your teacher will provide you with a detailed **rubric** for this assignment.
This describes how each part of the project will be graded, as well as how
many points each part can earn.

Submitting Your Work
--------------------

Your teacher will provide instructions for sharing the URL for your project
and/or demonstrating your application to the class.
